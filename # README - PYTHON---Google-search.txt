create a PYTHON app that shows the first 10 search results from google

ChatGPT
Creating a Python app to fetch the first 10 search results from Google involves a few steps. We'll use the googlesearch-python library, which is an easy way to perform Google searches programmatically. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Install the necessary library:
First, install the googlesearch-python package. You can do this using pip:

sh
Copy code
pip install googlesearch-python
Create the Python script:
Next, create a Python script that uses this library to fetch the first 10 search results. Here is an example of how this can be done:

python
Copy code
from googlesearch import search

def get_google_search_results(query, num_results=10):
    # Perform the search
    results = search(query, num_results=num_results)
    
    # Display the results
    for i, result in enumerate(results):
        print(f"{i+1}: {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    query = input("Enter your search query: ")
    get_google_search_results(query)
Run the script:
Save the script to a file, for example google_search.py, and then run it using Python:
sh
Copy code
python google_search.py
When you run the script, it will prompt you to enter a search query. After you enter the query, it will display the first 10 search results.

Detailed Explanation:
Importing the library:

python
Copy code
from googlesearch import search
This imports the search function from the googlesearch library.

Defining the function:

python
Copy code
def get_google_search_results(query, num_results=10):
This function takes a query string and an optional num_results integer, defaulting to 10.

Performing the search:

python
Copy code
results = search(query, num_results=num_results)
The search function returns a list of URLs that match the query.

Displaying the results:

python
Copy code
for i, result in enumerate(results):
    print(f"{i+1}: {result}")
This loop iterates through the search results and prints them with their corresponding index.

Running the script:

python
Copy code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    query = input("Enter your search query: ")
    get_google_search_results(query)
This code block ensures the script runs only if it is executed directly, and not if it is imported as a module.

This simple app demonstrates how to perform a Google search and display the results using Python. If you want to enhance this further, you can add error handling, logging, and a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like tkinter. ðŸš€ðŸ˜Š
